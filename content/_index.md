The Asia-Pacific Typhoon Collaborative Research Center (AP-TCRC) is an official institution, established with the support of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Pacific/ WMO Typhoon Committee. It aims to be a center of coordinated research and typhoon technology transfer mainly in Asia and the Pacific, and potentially over the globe.

The AP-TCRC will establish the International Scientific Steering Committee (ISSC) and invite distinguished tropical cyclone scientists as members. ISSC will also include representatives from the Typhoon Committee to provide technical advice on research activities of the AP-TCRC.

The roles of ISSC are as follows:

- Advise on the strategic plan on the long-term goals of the AP-TCRC.
- Advise on annual work plan and implementation strategy of the AP-TCRC.
- Evaluate and advise on the achievements of cooperation projects of the AP-TCRC.
